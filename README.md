## About The Project

During my studies in Software and Information Systems Engineering, we learned application developemnt using C# with WPF and Windows Form.
We've Learned many aspects of Object Oriented Programming including Multithreaded programming.
This was my First project in C# utilizing Windows Forms. From here my skills grew and improved. 
This project is an easy basic Process Managment app that shows all the processes currently on the OS, with the option of terminating them.
Note that Processes with Admin Access are restricted to the standard user. You can't terminate them.

### Built With
C# Windows Form Applications

You can search for a process via name or id, and terminate it. easy as can be.
